# Sunny's Diwali Sales Analysis

Welcome to my Diwali Sales Analysis project! This notebook explores sales data from a Diwali festival campaign, using Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate insights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, and product category
- Custom visualizations with modern color themes (sky blue, red, green, glassy effects)
- Actionable conclusions for business strategy
